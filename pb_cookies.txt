Ingredients:


    1 3/4 cups (430 ml) unbleached all-purpose flour
    1 teaspoon (5 ml) baking powder
    1/2 cup (125 ml) unsalted butter, softened
    1/2 cup (125 ml) creamy or crunchy peanut butter
    1/2 cup (125 ml) sugar
    1/2 cup (125 ml) brown sugar, firmly packed
    2 eggs
    1/2 cup (125 ml) unsalted peanuts, toasted


Directions:

    Preheat the oven to 190 °C (375 °F).
    In a bowl, combine the flour and baking powder.
    In another bowl, cream the butter, sugar, brown sugar and peanut butter with an electric mixer. Add the eggs and beat until the mixture is smooth. With a wooden spoon, stir in the peanuts but set 30 ml (2 tablespoons) aside to decorate the cookies. Also with a wooden spoon, stir in the flour.
    Scoop 30 ml (2 tablespoons) of dough for each cookie on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Scatter the remaining peanuts on the cookies. With a floured fork, lightly flatten the cookies.
    Bake in the middle of the oven for about 10 minutes or until lightly browned.
